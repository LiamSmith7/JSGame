# JSGame
A game test

TODO:
    - Raycast to detect entities (of a certain kind)
    - Raycast to find block
    - A* Pathfinding for certain entities
    - Reorganise code into different files
    - Reorganise entity objects (All entities are currently "living" and use same movement method)
    - Raycast faster projectiles (using raycast to detect entities and raycast to find point) for more accurate simulation
